# üìä ML Project with MLflow + DagsHub Integration

This project showcases a complete machine learning workflow integrated with **MLflow** for experiment tracking and **DagsHub** for version control, monitoring, and visualization. It demonstrates how to efficiently manage datasets, models, and metrics throughout the ML lifecycle.

---

## üîç Overview

‚úÖ **MLflow**: Used for tracking experiments, parameters, metrics, models, and artifacts.  
‚úÖ **DagsHub**: Git-based platform that helps visualize and monitor ML projects, with built-in support for MLflow UI, data versioning (via DVC), and model registry.

---

## üéØ Project Objective

Train a machine learning model (e.g., sentiment analysis, classification, regression) and:

- Track all experiments using **MLflow**
- Store & visualize experiment logs and metrics via **DagsHub**
- Version control code, data, and models in one unified platform
- Collaborate on ML experiments with transparency and reproducibility
